Huffman compressor with a nice GUI built with raylib
this was done by me (zeyadcode) and ahmed shawky
the project makes heavy use of C++ threads in order to handle gui operations in parallel while processing the compressing/decompressing algoirthm itself
it also makes use of memory map in order to be as efficient as possible when reading data
